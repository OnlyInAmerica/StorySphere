# StorySphere

This is an experiment in rendering Photospheres plain and simple with OpenGL.


# Issues

+ Currently full-resolution Photospheres have too many bits. Tested successfully with 4096x2048 images on a Nexus5.
+ The sensing of the initial phone position can be off, we should have some way to "reset" the camera perspective to dead center etc.
